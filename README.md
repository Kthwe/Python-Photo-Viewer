# Python-Photo-Viewer

This program used to view photos from specific directory. It will need Pyinstaller to convert to executable file for best performance. Recommended command line is *path/to/pyinstaller.exe player_tk.py --icon=icon12.ico --onefile --noconsole*. Once done, drag and drop the video from desired path to start playing. It will automatically load all photos. *Up key* is to select currently viewing photo to favoured path named Up. The concept goes for all the arrow keys. Plus, 1-9 keys also works with the same principle.
